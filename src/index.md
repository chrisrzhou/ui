# Getting Started

This site provides progressive documentation for React UI components and design system used across my personal projects.

## What is Covered?

Documentation covers the following areas:

- [Colors](./Colors)
- [Typography](./Typography)
- [Animations](./Animations)
- React components

## Component Philosophy

- **Simple**: Less is better. Reduce features and complexity in favor of rapid progressive development.
- **Atomic**: Self-contained and easy to compose.
- **Natural**: Good UI and animations should provide intuitive UI feedback to the user.

## TODO

- `Typography`
- `globalStyles`
- `Provider`
- `Background`
- `Image`
- `Tooltip`
- `Card`
- `PageSpinner`
- `Input(s)`
- `TextArea`
- `ButtonGroup`
- Animations (composable with components)
